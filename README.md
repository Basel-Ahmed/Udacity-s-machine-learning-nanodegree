The projects are 
- 1 - [Deployment sentiment analysis model for movie review]()
  - Build and deploy a deep learning model that predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review using Amazon SageMaker.
    In addition, create a simple web app that uses your deployed model and accepts user input.
    
- 2 - [Plagiarism detector](https://github.com/Basel-Ahmed/Udacity-s-machine-learning-nanodegree/tree/main/ML_sagemaker_studies/Project_Plagiarism_Detection)
  - I use my machine learning skills to define similarity metrics between two text documents and identify cases of plagiarism. 
    Then perform feature engineering and train and deploy a custom, plagiarism-classification model using Amazon SageMaker.
