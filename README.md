This repository contains projects for [Udacity's machine learning nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t), and these projects are

-  [Deployment of sentiment analysis model for movie review]()
    - Build and deploy a deep learning model that predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review using Amazon SageMaker.
      In addition, create a simple web app that uses your deployed model and accepts user input.
    
-  [Plagiarism detector](https://github.com/Basel-Ahmed/Udacity-s-machine-learning-nanodegree/tree/main/ML_sagemaker_studies/Project_Plagiarism_Detection)
    -  Use my machine learning skills to define similarity metrics according to this [paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf) between two text documents and         identify cases of plagiarism. 
      Then perform feature engineering and train and deploy a custom, plagiarism-classification model using Amazon SageMaker.

-  [Starbucks APP customer rewards program](https://github.com/Basel-Ahmed/Udacity-s-machine-learning-nanodegree/tree/main/ML_capstone_project)
    - This the graduation project of the nanodegree.
    - In this project, Starbucks wants to connect offer data, customer data, and transaction data (operational data) to gain insights about customer behavior and the overall                 effectiveness of offers as a value for business.
    - It contains it's own readme file for more detailed information about the project
  
  
## Installation 
- The deployment of sentiment analysis model for a movie review and the plagiarism detection projects must be run on an amazon sagemaker instance that has an IAM role that allows access to the S3 resource and computation instances specifically ml.m4.xlarge train instance. Also, must use python 3.5.
- For the third project it does not need amazon sagemaker just jupyter notebook with python 3.5
